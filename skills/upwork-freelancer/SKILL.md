### React Native / Mobile App

```
[CLIENT'S APP NAME] caught my attention — [specific detail from their description].

I've built 15+ production React Native apps with Expo and bare CLI, including [similar app type].
My apps average 4.8★ on app stores and I've reduced crash rates by 80%+ using Sentry + proper
error boundaries.

For your project, I'd approach it as:
• Week 1: Architecture setup, navigation (Expo Router), auth flow, design system
• Week 2-3: Core features with offline support + optimistic updates
• Week 4: Polish, EAS Build CI/CD, TestFlight/Play Console delivery

Recent win: Built a [similar app] for a US client in 6 weeks — now has 10k+ MAU with 99.9% crash-free sessions.

Mind if I ask 2 quick questions to scope this accurately? Happy to share my portfolio.
```

### Node.js / Backend API

```
Your need for a [specific backend feature] is exactly the kind of system I build.

I've architected 20+ production APIs — REST and GraphQL — using NestJS, Prisma, and Redis.
I prioritize clean architecture so your codebase stays maintainable as you scale.

My approach for your project:
• API design + database schema review first (prevents costly pivots)
• NestJS modules with proper separation of concerns
• JWT auth with refresh tokens + role-based access
• Full test coverage (unit + e2e) before delivery

Past result: Refactored a legacy Express API to NestJS for a SaaS startup — reduced response times
by 60% and cut server costs 40% with better caching architecture.

Can we jump on a 15-minute call to align on requirements before I give you a final timeline?
```

### Full Stack Web (Next.js)

```
I noticed you need [specific feature] — this is a pattern I've implemented multiple times.

I specialize in Next.js 14 (App Router), TypeScript, and Tailwind/shadcn-ui. My full-stack apps
typically achieve 95+ Lighthouse scores and are SEO-optimized from day one.

Proposed stack for your project:
• Frontend: Next.js 14 App Router + Tailwind + shadcn/ui
• Backend: Next.js API routes + Prisma + PostgreSQL
• Auth: NextAuth.js
• Deploy: Vercel + Supabase (zero-downtime, auto-scaling)

Delivered a similar SaaS dashboard for a B2B client in 3 weeks — it now processes $2M+ in monthly
transactions with 99.9% uptime.

Would you like me to break down a day-by-day delivery schedule for your specific requirements?

### Discovery / Clarification Call

```
Hi [Name],

Thanks for reaching out! I've reviewed your job post and I'm confident I can deliver exactly what
you need.

Before I send a detailed proposal/quote, would you be open to a quick 15-minute call to:
1. Confirm the technical requirements
2. Discuss your timeline and priorities
3. Ensure we're aligned on success criteria

I'm available [Day/Time options in their timezone]. Does any of those work?

Looking forward to connecting!
[Your Name]
```

### Project Kickoff Message

```
Hi [Name],

Excited to get started! Here's how I'll approach the first week:

**Day 1-2:** Setup & architecture
- Repo setup with [stack], folder structure, CI/CD pipeline
- Share staging environment access

**Day 3-5:** [First milestone feature]
- [Specific deliverable 1]
- [Specific deliverable 2]

**My communication style:**
• Daily Slack/message update
• Loom video walkthrough each Friday
• You can reach me Mon-Fri, response within 2 hours

First question: Do you have existing designs (Figma) or should I create UI components based on your references?

Let's build something great! 🚀
```

### Scope Change Request

```
Hi [Name],

Thanks for the new request — [describe what they asked]. Happy to add this!

Quick note: this is outside our original agreed scope, which covered [original scope].
The new feature will require approximately [X hours] of additional work.

Options:
1. Add it to the current contract (+$[amount] or +[hours])
2. Scope it as a follow-up contract after delivery
3. Swap it with [lower-priority item] from the current scope

What works best for you? No pressure either way — I just want to be transparent so there are
no surprises at the end.
```

### Requesting a Review

```
Hi [Name],

Really enjoyed working on [project name] with you! Seeing [specific result, e.g., "the app hit
1,000 downloads in the first week"] is exactly why I do this work.

If you have 2 minutes, a review on Upwork would mean a lot — it helps me continue working with
great clients like you. The link is in your Upwork contracts page.

And please reach out anytime if you need updates, new features, or have questions. I offer
priority support to past clients.

Thanks again, [Name]!
[Your Name]
```

### Handling Vague/Changing Requirements

```
Hi [Name],

Thanks for the update. I want to make sure I understand this correctly before proceeding.

As I understand it, you'd like me to [restate their request in your words]. Is that accurate?

Also, I want to clarify [specific unclear point] — currently it does [current behavior],
and you'd like it to [new behavior]. Correct?

Once I have your confirmation, I can complete this within [X hours/days].
```

## Project Scoping Template

```markdown
## Project Scope - [Project Name]

**Client:** [Name]
**Date:** [Date]
**Budget:** $[X] | **Timeline:** [X weeks]

### In Scope
- [Feature 1]
- [Feature 2]
- [Feature 3]

- Payment processing integration
- Admin dashboard

### Milestones & Payments

| 2 | Core features | 50% | Week 3 |

```

## Rate & Negotiation

```
When client lowballs: "I appreciate your interest in my work. My rate reflects [X years of
experience / past results / specialized expertise]. I'm not able to go lower without compromising
quality. That said, we could reduce scope to fit your budget — would you like me to suggest a
smaller initial phase?"

When raising rates for existing client: "I've enjoyed working with you over [period]. Starting
[date], my rate will be $[new rate]/hr to reflect my updated experience level. I'd love to
continue our work together at the new rate — let me know how you'd like to proceed."
```

## Red Flags to Avoid

- ❌ "We'll pay after it goes live"
- ❌ "It's a simple project" with 50-line description
- ❌ No milestone payments offered
- ❌ "We have an existing codebase" with no code access before bidding
- ❌ "We need it in 3 days" for 3-month scope
- ❌ "Previous developer disappeared" (check why)
